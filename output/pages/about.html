    <p>My interest in education grew from circumstances and have been fostered in the last few years in both classroom-based and technology-based settings. Having grown up with a program called Prep for Prep for underserved students and seen the disparities between public schools and prep schools, I have always been interested in how large differences in educational resources contribute to social inequities.</p>
<p>It was not until I went back to graduate school to study statistics that I found an avenue to get involved in this subject. I am interested in the potential for open source technology to equalize access available for students with different needs and different learning styles. I am also interested in how data analytics can be a tool to match students to appropriate content and to change the way that they get feedback. </p>
<p>I am currently working at Khan Academy exploring the possibilities in the intersection of technology and education. I also love such things as trail runs, occassional dance parties, and (eating, making, thinking about) ramen. </p>
