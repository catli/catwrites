</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Recently, NPR posted an <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/12/29/460143133/how-writing-down-specific-goals-can-empower-you">article</a> describing an effective tool for building student motivation: writing about one’s goals. The impact of conscious goal-setting on performance and productivity has been studied for many decades, but only recently have these theories been practiced as writing-based intervention programs. </p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.palgrave-journals.com/articles/palcomms201514">longitudinal research study</a> at a European business school, the intervention program significantly increased retention rates and course credits for students most at risk of dropping out. Another <a href="http://selfauthoring.com/JAPcomplete.pdf">study</a> at the University of Toronto, conducted by Morisano et al., found that students given written interventions saw increased GPA, increased likelihood of retaining their course load, and fewer negative affects like stress and distraction.</p>
<p>What is the recipe in these intervention programs that builds student motivation in relatively short periods? The premise of this work is based on goal-setting theories developed over 35 years of research.  Clear goals help individuals direct their energy towards more relevant and interesting tasks, and increase their enthusiasm, creating a virtuous cycle which leads to greater self-discovery and focus. </p>
<p>In Professor Jordan’s Maps of Meaning class at the University of Toronto,  students write essays to envision their ideal future and what they want to avoid. Students also have a chance to explore elements of their past, along with their strengths and weaknesses in the present. These exercises culminate into a written statement of individual goals and ambitions. </p>
<p>This work hold promise potentially for students in otherwise challenging educational settings. There also seems to be a lot of room to further explore this topic, including how various segments of the population can benefit. For example, in the case of the Toronto study, native English speaker were found to benefit much more from the intervention program. Additionally, there has yet to be a study of the impact these programs have on high school and middle school students. </p>
